            <p>For my photography element the first decision I took was to use my mobile phone as choice of camera, this photography website will back up the pros for mobile phone photography that I found aided me during this project were “Always on you, same time editing and automatic back-up” (The Smartphone Photographer, 2021), I used the first advantage of having on me when out for a walk and the perfect lighting was available for photos of Old Trafford and Hotel football which wouldn’t have been should I have used a bigger camera and same time editing for the local park picture to change the background lighting. The other big decision I undertook in this project was setting my pictures up correctly. To do this I focused on key areas, I used the different lightings of the day to help create a different mood for the photos in my project. I used different angles to portray places in different ways for example taking Old Trafford in a low angle shot to show the stature it has, and a high angle shot of local football being played to show another photography skills off which was contrast and creating the contrast in my content ranging from somewhere huge like Old Trafford to somewhere small being the local games.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Video Production</h2>

            <p>For the video production element once given the brief we decided our idea and got to planning which was key as when we went to film, we knew what we wanted to do and where and allowed our filming to run smoothly. In our video we used different shots such as wide, establishing and close-ups to have a variety, we also did this as we knew we were working for a client and we watched what the client had done previously, and imitated a similar structure to what they had. The hardest part of filming this brief was keeping to the client’s deadlines but as we had a clear structure, we were able to do this. We investigated websites like indeed and found the most important factors when working with a client are “exceed expectations, respect time and respect one another” (Indeed, 2021) and as a group we kept in mind these things and allowed us to fulfil the brief successfully. When filming we also had to look at the safety of us and the people around us, so we completed location Recces and call sheets to assess the potential obstacles and dangers when out filming, by completing these pieces of paperwork it meant we had no issues when out in the field. (An example of one of our completed Recce’s and Call sheets will be included in the references)</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Social Media Delivery</h2>



            <p>For the social media formatting we had to differ from our video production as social medias such as Instagram and Facebook use square framing. For the social media clip, we decided to explore it intended for Instagram we chose this as we felt that this was the format that would suit our intended target audience, when researching it I found that “29.8% of all 18–24-year-olds use Instagram with 15.3% male and 14.5% female.” (Statista, 2021) We explored other options such as Tik Tok however we found that when we researched the users of Tik Tok in the UK we found that only “24% of 15-24-year-olds use Tik Tok” (Statista, 2021), because of this we decided to go with Instagram as out social media outlet. The struggle we faced when completing the social media segment was finding the right framing for Instagram, through looking on our editing software Adobe Premiere we changed the video from landscape to a portrait video. We also had to figure out how to frame the on-screen action in centre screen which we managed to do through going through each individual bit filmed and centring the main part we wanted on screen.</p>
