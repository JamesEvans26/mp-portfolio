          <p>When considering my colour choices for my website I first considered the text and background colour that I wanted for the body of text, I decided to go with neutral colours of Black and White as these are suggested colours for background and text on websites. One website I found suggests this by saying “Neutrals are typically used for text, backgrounds, or anything else that does not need to compete for attention.” (Fitzgerald, 2019) For this reasoning and the reasoning that it is clear and easy to read is why I chose to add these colours to the website, it also allows me to have a professional look on the site. I also experimented with colour on the background header photo as I added a red mist over it, as on websites “Red is associated with lust, excitement, love, energy, and movement.” (99designs, 2015) I contrasted this by using blue text over the top of the red mist, contrasting the red as blue is seen as being a colour that depicts calmness and security. I feel that having this vast contrast of colours on my website gives it a good overall balance and does not go over the top.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Typography</h2>

          <p>For my font choices I made on the website I first looked at the headings on my site and chose to go with ‘Open-Sans’ a sans serif font I chose as it was easy to read and looked professional on the website. I also looked at the navigation and body font for the website and chose another sans serif font in ‘Noto Sans’ which allows both fonts to co-exist on the website and not overload the website by having too many fonts, a book on web designs adds on this saying “These types of fonts have a cleaner and more contemporary feel.” (Beaird, Walker and George, 2020) Adding that using sans serif fonts the website I have created has a modern look compared to websites that may use a serif font. The text colours I talked on earlier were black and blue for the site which were chosen for different reasons I chose black as it made the information easy to read and blue so that the website gave off a calmness on the site to complement the red. I also looked at the layout of my text on each page and decided on the best code snippet for the website that gave it that professional look.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Accesibility</h2>



          <p></p>

          <p>For the accessibility part of my website, I have included five working links for easy guided access to all the created pages available on my website. Placed at the top of the screen so viewers to the website can gain quick and easy access to all pages. For any viewers to the website that have any visual impairments I have included ‘ALT’ text on the website for any pictures so that they are able to obtain the same great experience on my website as everyone else, giving my website an equality factor to it. Upon research ‘ALT’ text can also be important for other issues such as “To aid visually impaired, If the image fails to load or for search engines to locate your website” (DevotePress, 2021), this adds to the importance that ‘ALT’ text has on my website. When considering the accessibility of the website I also had to ensure as mentioned in typography that the fonts I chose would be legible and the sizing made sense and looked right for what I was putting on there. Critically I also had to ensure the colour scheme was right for people to be able to view my content and that it isn’t a struggle for viewers to read.</p>
